## Description
The **Proyecto-Interfaces** repository is dedicated to the development and maintenance of the necessary codes for a car interface. This project is divided into two main components: Arduino code and a visual dashboard developed in Python.

## Components

### Arduino
In the `Arduino` folder, you will find the following files:
- `CustomESP32UDP`: A custom library for handling UDP communication with the ESP32.
- `car_control.ino`: The main Arduino sketch that controls various functionalities of the car.

### Python
The `Python` folder contains the necessary code for the car's visual dashboard, including:
- `dashboard_control.py`: The main script for controlling the dashboard.
- `dashboard_visual`: A directory containing visual resources and the `dashboard_visual.py` script for the graphical interface.

## Installation and Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
3. Upload the Arduino code to your compatible board.
4. Run the Python script to start the dashboard.
